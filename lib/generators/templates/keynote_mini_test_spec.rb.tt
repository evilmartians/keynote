# Specs in this file have access to the present (or k) method, which they can
# use to instantiate <%= class_name %>Presenter as normal. For example:
#
#   describe <%= class_name %>Presenter do
#     it "has access to a view" do
#       k(<%= presenter_name_and_target_list %>).should respond_to(:view)
#     end
#   end

describe <%= class_name %>Presenter do
